\section{Introduction}

Time is important. So you might want to know how long someone
has been using your program, or what time of day it is; you
might want to make something happen exactly 10 times per second;
in any case, you need to know what Python can do about time.
This sheet tells you about that.

\section{The `time' module}

If you say |import time| then after that you can use a number
of functions for working with times. If you're curious about
what ``|import|'' means, see Sheet~M (\emph{Modules}).

\subsection{Telling the time}

|time.time()| gives the number of seconds since the very beginning
of the year 1970. You may think this is a strange way to represent
time. You'd be right too, but fortunately Python provides ways of
turning this sort of time into something more useful.

|time.localtime(t)|, if |t| is a time value produced by |time.time()|,
is an object made up of 9 numbers. Here's what it produced for me
using the time right now:

\begin{interaction}
>>> \T{time.localtime(time.time())}
(1999, 8, 10, 17, 21, 16, 1, 222, 1)
\end{interaction}

Those 9 numbers are, in order:
\begin{tabular}{rl}
0 & the year \\
1 & the month of the year (January is 1, December is 12) \\
2 & The day of the month \\
3 & The hour of the day (in the 24-hour clock: so |17| means 5pm \\
4 & The minute of the hour \\
5 & The number of seconds past the minute \\
6 & The day of the \emph{week} (Monday is 0, Sunday is 6) \\
7 & The day number within the year (1 January is 1) \\
8 & 1 if ``daylight saving time'' is in force, 0 otherwise
\end{tabular}

So, you can use this to make a simple clock.

\begin{program}
import time
while 1:
  t = time.localtime(time.time())
  print 'The time is', t[3], ':', t[4], 'and', t[5], 'sec'.
  time.sleep(1)   \C{I'll explain this in a moment.}
\end{program}

\subsection{Describing the time}

There's a complicated function called |time.strftime| which
lets you print times more neatly. If you want to know the
gruesome details, ask a leader. Here's a little example.

\begin{interaction}
>>> \T{import time}
>>> \T{time.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y, at %I:%M%p', time.localtime(time.time()))}
'Tuesday, 10 August 1999, at 05:41PM'
\end{interaction}

\subsection{Waiting}

|time.sleep(0.1234)| does absolutely nothing for 0.1234 seconds
(or as close to that as the machine can manage).
